Implemented these search algorithms

def search_A(kitchen_items=[], goal_node=None)

selects the candidate (function unit) which has lower cost (cost of motion + number of i/p's),
it's a BFS algortihm.


def iterative_deepening_search(kitchen_items=[], goal_node=None)

selects the first candidate but runs each iteration with increased depth, it's a DFS algorithm.


Execution from main method

Run search.py script to generate the text files for each goal node
